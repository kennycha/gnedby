= SPEC-1: gnedby - A CLI Tool to Track CD/LP Purchase History
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

gnedby is a command-line tool for managing your CD/LP collection. It allows you to easily add album information using Apple Music links, view lists and summary reports with various filters, and supports synchronization using Supabase.

== Requirements

- Must Have
  * User can add a music album by providing an Apple Music album ID
  * User can add a music album manually with interactive prompts
  * Album metadata (artist, album title, genre, release date, country, artwork) is fetched automatically
  * Support for various formats `[--format <cd|lp|usb|tape>]` (default is cd)
  * List (`show`) and summary report (`report`) commands with filters: year, artist, genre, format, country
  * Local persistent storage using SQLite
  * Sync command structure with check/push/pull support
  * Secure token storage using system keychain
  * User can run a web server with `gnedby serve`
  * User can view their album collection in a responsive web interface (SSR)
  * User can access album data via REST API endpoints (`/api/albums`, `/api/albums/{id}`)

- Should Have
  * Extensible CLI architecture (e.g. to support Bandcamp in future)
  * Pretty CLI output (table formatting, optional colors)
  * Order by options for album listings

- Could Have
  * Config file for defaults
  * Automated backups during sync operations

- Won't Have (initially)
  * Price tracking
  * Purchase location/date fields

== Method

The CLI is implemented in Rust, using `clap` for command parsing, `rusqlite` for database interactions, `reqwest` for HTTP-based metadata extraction, and encrypted token storage. The architecture includes the following components:

CLI -> Database : DELETE FROM albums WHERE id = ?
User -> CLI : show [--year] [--artist] [--genre] [--format] [--country] [--order-by]

RemoteStore --> CLI : metadata JSON
CLI -> RemoteStore : Upload/Download albums.db
User -> CLI : sync config show | set | reset
CLI -> EncryptedStorage : Store/retrieve tokens
User -> CLI : serve
CLI -> WebServer : start
WebServer -> Database : SELECT * FROM albums
User -> WebServer : GET /
WebServer -> TemplateEngine : render albums.html with data

=== Command Structure (Final)

[source,bash]

gnedby add <album_id> [--format <cd|lp|usb|tape>]
gnedby manual-add [--format <cd|lp|usb|tape>]
gnedby delete <id>
gnedby show [--year <YYYY>] [--artist <name>] [--genre <genre>] [--format <cd|lp|usb|tape>] [--country <country>] [--order-by id|album|artist|year]

----

=== Database Schema

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE albums (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    artist TEXT NOT NULL,
    album TEXT NOT NULL,
    genre TEXT,
    release_date TEXT,
    format TEXT,
    source_url TEXT,
    country TEXT,
    artwork_url TEXT
);
----

=== Web Server Implementation

- Uses axum for HTTP server
- Uses askama for SSR HTML rendering
- Serves static files (CSS, JS) for the web UI
- Provides REST API endpoints for album data

==== Endpoints

- `/` : SSR HTML album list (responsive)
- `/api/albums` : All albums (JSON)
- `/api/albums/{id}` : Single album (JSON)
- `/static/*` : Static assets (CSS, JS, images)

==== Features

- Thread-safe, async DB access for concurrent requests
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Automatic browser launch on server start

=== Metadata Extraction

Apple Music album IDs are looked up using the iTunes Search API.

Example API call:
[source,bash]
----
GET https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=1811804666&entity=album
----

This returns a JSON object from which the following fields are extracted:
- `artistName`
- `collectionName`
- `releaseDate`
- `primaryGenreName`
- `country`
- `artworkUrl100`

=== Sync Implementation

Sync follows a push/pull model with `check` support.

- Local file: `albums.db`
- Remote file: `albums.db` + `meta.json`
- Sync Steps:
  * `check`: Compare SHA256 hash with remote metadata
  * `push`: Upload DB and metadata to Supabase Storage
  * `pull`: Download and overwrite local DB (with automatic backup)
  * `backup`: Create backup of database before overwriting

=== Configuration System

Users must configure their Supabase Storage target and token before using sync commands. This is done using the `gnedby sync config` command.

==== Supported Keys

- `storage_url` – Supabase bucket base URL (e.g. `https://<project-id>.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/gnedby-sync`)
- `token` – Supabase access token (service_role token recommended)
- `auto_sync` – Boolean flag for automatic sync (default: false)

==== Example Usage

[source,bash]
----
gnedby sync config set storage_url https://project-id.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/gnedby-sync
gnedby sync config set token eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI...
gnedby sync config set auto_sync true

gnedby sync config show
gnedby sync config reset
----

Configuration settings are stored in `~/.config/gnedby/sync_config.json`, with tokens securely stored in the system keychain/credential manager.

=== Secure Token Storage

For security, authentication tokens are stored with encryption:

- XOR encryption with a machine-specific key
- Base64 encoding for storage
- SHA-256 to generate the encryption key from machine-specific information
- Stored in the application's configuration file but in encrypted form

This prevents sensitive tokens from being easily readable in configuration files.

=== Supabase Sync Implementation

For multi-device usage and safe synchronization, gnedby uses Supabase Storage as its remote backend.

==== Structure

Supabase bucket: `gnedby-sync`
- `albums.db` - Main SQLite database file
- `meta.json` - Metadata used for safe syncing

meta.json example:
[source,json]
----
{
  "hash": "d4c3b4a1f2e1...",
  "last_sync": "2025-05-03T15:30:00Z"
}
----

==== Authentication

The user must obtain a Supabase token (preferably service_role) from the Supabase dashboard and configure it:

[source,bash]
----
gnedby sync config set token <supabase_token>
----

The token is securely stored with encryption in the configuration file.

==== CLI Commands

[source,bash]
----
gnedby sync check [-v]
gnedby sync pull
gnedby sync push
----

- `check`: Compares local SHA256 hash of albums.db with remote meta.json
  * `-v`: Shows number of added, deleted, and updated albums
- `push`: Uploads current albums.db and updates meta.json
- `pull`: Downloads remote albums.db and backs up local copy first

==== Libraries

- `reqwest` for HTTP requests
- `serde_json` for JSON encoding/decoding
- `sha2` for hash comparison and encryption
- `base64` for token encoding/decoding
- Supabase Storage REST API endpoints for file handling

== Gathering Results

Evaluation of the `gnedby` tool will focus on the following criteria:

- Correctness: Is metadata accurately retrieved and stored?
- Usability: Are CLI commands and options intuitive and responsive?
- Performance: Are operations fast, even with large datasets?
- Portability: Does it run on macOS, Windows, and Linux without issues?
- Sync Safety: Does sync logic prevent overwrites and allow safe use across multiple devices?
- Security: Are tokens properly encrypted and protected from casual access?
- Extendability: Can new sources or formats be integrated easily?

User testing over a 2–4 week period will guide refinements.
